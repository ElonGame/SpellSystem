### About the Spell System
In the new system you will find a massive amount of new tools, systems and options to not only bring to life a functional Spell System for your game, but one that has a fast setup, workflow and can easily be extended to do just about anything. In addition to just the spells, we are including Ranged AI capable of casting a number of spells, A Main Menu / Load Level System based off of SQL Lite or EasySave2.

We included a resist system that mitigates damage based on damage types. We included Magic Weapons, We included Teleports, and Creature Summons, Scripts to increase spell size by level. We even created a leveling system with point allocation upon level up. Oh and an entire attribute system that can hook into other existing systems. Oh yea, and fire breathing Iguana's! Like i said, Kings of Feature Creep.

Please have a read under the documentation for instructions. Even at the time of writing this, i'm sure there are cool features we forgot to document. From the Shades of Insomnia Team, Enjoy. Below is the link to the unity package containing a completely setup Project (Requires Invector Melee)
